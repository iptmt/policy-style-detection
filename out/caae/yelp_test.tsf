this was by far the rudest person i spoke with .	this was one of the best store i went .	1
the rest of their food is edible but their employees and service are horrible .	the customer service is great and the service are great and service are great .	1
as for the food , never had it .	for the food , it loved it .	1
however , the tech said nothing to me about this .	however , the atmosphere goes to me about this .	1
i 'm from the bay area and this was a disappointment and over priced .	i was a party of my room and it was perfect for reasonably priced .	1
my mom ordered the teriyaki chicken bento box and i ordered the sashimi box .	my husband ordered the carne asada burrito and the sandwich was the best side .	1
i ordered garlic bread and fettuccine alfredo pasta with vegetables .	i love their bread and cheese with cheese dishes .	1
it does not take that long to cook sliders !	it does not get to get a drink !	1
the sandwich was not that great .	the pizza was great too .	1
the man did not stop her .	the store itself is gorgeous .	1
um ... we just told him that we did n't want to finance .	when we thought when we did n't go to see you know .	1

food was alright maybe we should have ordered off the mexican menu .	the food was good we have never love the bar bar .	1
lastly but not least , their brownie desert was ... meh .	oh , their chips and salsa was ok , good .	1
it shows that this restaurant has no class .	it 's 's great place has great type .	1
one broken thing after another they do n't care to address .	one of my new places to get they are great .	1
we 've been to this long established restaurant many times .	we have to get this one of happy flavor .	1
my plate looked nearly half empty except for the small container of cole slaw .	my new menu is perfect for the hot selection of the bar .	1
when i arrived , no one was at the desk .	when i was no one at the front desk .	1
we gave it another 5-10 minutes before we got up and left .	we got it a few minutes later and we got it .	1
even the ice cream was very , very run of the mill .	my family was very better , very much of the end .	1
wendy 's has been know to be cheap with their drink refills for years .	this place has has to get a lot of good selection with good prices .	1
as soon as they delivered i was like ugh .	when they were with me , he was gross .	1
the service is mediocre and the restaurant is just average .	the service is excellent and the food is just average .	1
but i darn sure could have cooked this one .	but i 'll see this one of one .	1
just terrible is all i can say .	is great as i could say .	1
did they not have a fountain machine on site ?	they have a lot of home 's heaven !	1
his egg sandwiches stink like feet and are slimy .	the chips are huge and salsa are amazing .	1
stay away , and go to cheesecake instead .	go here to eat , and accessories .	1
we stood there in shock , because we never expected this .	we went there in all , we will love this .	1
i 've eaten here many times , but none as bad as last night .	i have some here here is good , but a great price night .	1
always takes way too long even if you 're the only one there .	always get more more than you can get the other care there .	1
however , everyone else paid after their nails were completed .	however , everyone here there was all both wonderful .	1
so , that was my one and only time ordering the benedict there .	so my first time , and the first time there was the there .	1
overall , i do n't enjoy the place very much .	overall i will definitely be here , so much .	1
one of the employees apologized , but it did n't seem very sincere .	the first of customer service , and they are always very nice .	1
there is a reason they can get you in fairly quickly .	there is a lot they can get you are in .	1
is zero stars an option ?	is a great place !	1
in the long run , they did absolutely nothing for me .	the other of us , they always get it right .	1
but let this story begin at noon today .	but this place to eat for lunch here .	1
seriously though , i have never shopped here .	also , i have gone here here .	1
it is the absolute worse place in the valley .	it is the best place in the valley .	1
but their inventory was questionable !	but the atmosphere was amazing !	1
chicken fried chicken was dry but the green chili macaroni and cheese was good .	the chicken sandwich was huge and the fried rice and cheese was good .	1
so he can charge a bloody fortune for them .	so she knows a great little for them .	1
were we irritating her or something ?	we were so nice !	1
this place has pissed me off for the last time .	this place has made me for the first time time .	1
do not sign a lease with these people .	definitely a great job with these people .	1
do n't waste the trip .	definitely worth the trip !	1

the restroom was a mess .	the room was a .	1
i mean that 's been my experience !	i love it 's my whole !	1
the beef taco was good but nothing special .	the steak was good and nothing special .	1
either way i would never recommend buying from camping world .	i will definitely be back for a classic gem .	1

its also not a very clean park .	also always a clean little clean .	1
i tried to call repeatedly with no response .	i got to return with a great .	1
they charged me for work not done , and parts not installed .	they get there are good , and wo n't go back .	1
it looks old and outdated .	it 's old and clean .	1
he did not return my call either .	he knows our whole family here .	1
if you travel a lot do not stay at this hotel .	thank you will a lot of this place to this point .	1
i would rather wait for hot food than have it cold and soggy .	i will definitely come here for more hot and delicious food .	1
the food here is bland and boring and bad .	the food here is excellent and fast and fast .	1
this one is not on the ball .	this is one of the city .	1
for the record i am a good cook , i use seasoning !	the first time i 'm a good deal , i 'm good !	1
the tow package is not an issue either .	the room is a great little place .	1
very crowded , difficult to have a chance to actually have a good time .	a nice to be back , a great place to get a good time .	1
i think it 's terrible when employees act that way .	i thought it 's great prices that makes me nice .	1
i 'll keep looking for a different salon .	i will continue such a great location .	1
you can not pay me to ever shop here !	you will continue to get coming here here !	1
french toast plate was good , mom said , but eggs were cold .	my shrimp sandwich was good , hot , and they were cold .	1
now the food : not horrible , but below average .	the food was great , but fast , affordable .	1
this is easily the worst greek food i 've had in my life .	this is my best mexican food i have ever had in my life .	1
no stars is what in want to give .	great place is great to see me .	1
when it came we should have sent it back .	when we got it got it made it .	1
the equipment is so old and looks dirty .	the atmosphere is so nice and clean .	1
i 'm not willing to take the chance .	i will continue to get the whole time .	1

sounds good does n't it ?	that is just it !	1

the overall prices are not competitive with frys .	the customer service is friendly and always .	1
too bad it was at the expense of the other customers .	it was good enough to the end of the customers .	1
we 'll see if that happens , but i 'm not holding my breath .	we 'll see me , but we will not recommend them my favorite .	1
and management does n't do anything about it .	customer service and they always worth it up !	1
no wonder these restaurants are closing up all around the valley .	these guys are great people are all the top notch .	1
what were you going to charge me when i purchase a dozen bagels ?	if you were to get a lot of you got no fries !	1
i 'm still craving my drunken noodles !	i am always my new hair !	1
these days the quality is pretty lousy .	the prices are a great too .	1
this woman should not be in the service industry in az with that attitude .	this place to be one of the best sushi shop at all .	1
service was average but could not make up for the poor food and drink .	customer service was good and always get better for the food and quick .	1
my husband had to walk up to the bar to place our wine order .	my family here to go to get the atmosphere was our whole meal .	1

so i ordered my tires online , scheduled an appointment for two days out .	my husband i got a great room , happy hour for the work .	1
hopefully , i do n't take any bed bugs with me .	i will definitely get some , hot , or me .	1
the beer is n't bad , but the food was less than desirable .	the food is good and the service was good , the happy hour .	1
when it finally came out , it was bad .	when it came out , it was good .	1
talk about false advertising so call before you go !	found me feel like you will see them !	1
the food is n't too bad but the service is terrible .	the food is good but the service is great customer service .	1
crab cakes , salt , no other flavor .	their chips , great fish , great flavor .	1
but the customer service ruins it all for me .	the customer service and it 's all around .	1

i also told him i would leave him some good feedback online .	i went me i will be back for a good job .	1
however , the manager came back & told me my order was coming up .	however , the atmosphere here was made me made me our order back .	1

i 'm not a fan of huge chain restaurants .	i am a fan fan of local italian .	1
the rice was cold and hard and the taste was very bland .	the pasta was huge and the sauce was very tasty and delicious .	1

let me tell you , this place was far from busy !	you come there , this place was thanks by far worth !	1
it 's not much like an actual irish pub , which is depressing .	it 's a real little little bar , which is a cute store .	1
the birthday surprise has been ruined as well as her special day .	the new room here has nothing special special special special day .	1
included in this price was a credit card fee and an after midnight fee .	my family here was a lot of breakfast and a great bar area .	1

the ceiling air conditioner in the hallway is very loud .	the grounds in the area is very nice .	1
we then placed our order with our extremely rude and apparently completely overwhelmed server .	we got my new here and there was great with nice and knowledgeable .	1
