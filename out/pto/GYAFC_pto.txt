it seems very complicated ; could you please explain it again in simple terms ?

if he insists then it indicates sex is his only goal .
i would enjoy having some fun with you , that is why i answered this ridiculous question .
do you feel in that manner ?
give your brother some money and inform him that he ought to leave .
possibly he will call you .
something you can o is imagine your life with out him or her .

i do not find a man appealing who behaves that way frequently .
i am attracted to men who shave their legs .

in my opinion , they do .
it is a wrong decision that can not be undone !

did you see her looking at you ?
i never knew that life could be so exceptional .
what is best for the both of you ?
at least she did n't give you a fake number .
therefore , in my opinion , you are not promiscuous .
however , let them get married if they can not control themselves .
she calls him often .
why bother if you are already doing it ?
many times you have loved a man , but were not sure if he loved you back .
should i break up with him because of his mother ?
make a nice move , and if there is no responce , she is not interested .
i have friends that get married after 6 months of dating .

i would suggest not worrying about it overmuch .
what is the worst thing that could occur ?
i am confused and do not know what to do because i hate for the girl to be that way .
you should find someone who does not hate you .

try to make the best out of a bad situation .
are you looking for friendship ?
i believe that he would make a great valentine .
this is difficult due to the many temptations .
does it generally take a year to feel comfortable or bored in a relationship ?
it will all depend on when you are ready .
of course i would love to meet women .
it is just the way things are .
it is ok to be friends with someone online , but there should be limits .
can you imagine starting a family with him ?
should he refuse your request , his value is too low to begin with .
to tell the truth , you will learn , but you must experience things .
hopefully , you married your husband because you love him .
i know i have someone who will be waiting when i come home .
get away from it all , go enjoy a massage .
i do not know where to start .
that depends , are you an attractive individual with an athletic form ?

getting married and having children can be <unk> , but your studies can not be .
i have never attended it .
do you want to be in a relationship with the same man ?
how often can you have sexual relations with pamela anderson ?

i am referring to the two of you collectively .
the right woman will come along if you are patient .
i desire my wife to grow as well .
he is obviously shy , perhaps you should make a move .

okay , it depends on how deeply you are starting to experience emotions for this boy !
in advance , thank you for the pep .

i would like a trip to an amusement park , or a museum .
i have feelings for a person and need to know if i am in love .
do you enjoy fake nails or <unk> nails ?
first , plan what you desire and do not worry about what everyone else desires .
i do not understand you .
i like the perfume that you wear .
i think most men do not care , but it does depend on the individual person .
it has nothing to do with being vulnerable , young or <unk> .
do not get married so early in the relationship .
you are not a good person of you plan to be unfaithful to your wife .
be the best version of yourself , and if he is impressed he will talk to you .
you do n't want to be with anyone , but that person .
he is getting married , stop pursuing it .

when i move in i was asked out by my neighbor .
most <unk> boys prefer teen girls like enjoy fornication .
he played a good game of basketball .
do not worry .
are you someone who enjoys arguing and fighting ?
the most important issue , is not attempt to retaliate at the individual that wronged you .
one man willing to move twenty-one hours and fourteen hundred miles just to be with me .
have you seen a doctor yet ?
perhaps she is not a <unk> , but the thin woman definitely was .
you should pursue an active life and not waste my time .
it is comparable to <unk> in chocolate and then complaining because you have gained weight .
i traveled there and he was present .
if he is single , go for it .
if you do not obey men like this , they typically become the sort who beat their wives .
are you or are you not attracted to him ?
if you are sure , however , then you should tell your parents is you have not already done so .
many people will probably reject you .
do you believe he has the same feelings towards you ?
some men only say that word , if they mean it .
it appears that he likes you , and should should show him how you feel .
i am of the opinion that everyone should keep their own name .
friends are forever because guys come and go .
try to imagine that it was considered love .

younger men and older women , good idea or not ?

therefore , there is no alternative to the proper <unk> of 'love . '

flowers are nice , even if the do not last long .
there are films that i have yet to see .
she is a very sweet girl , just the person you are looking for !
try to use your brain and not your manhood , maybe she does not love you .
no disrespect intended ; but , that does sound like a lady 's name .
i would not take the trouble to call him back .
no women i 'm attracted to in my list , therefore i choose my neighbors spouse .
marraige is about trust and communication .
do not listen to anyone else 's advice .
what should i do to be successful with her ?
give them a rose and express your love for them .
it is unusual , i agree , however it is nothing bad .
you need to see <unk> what 's correct for you both .
they are woman enough for a man , but they are n't as <unk> as us .
exactly , especially when she became sick .
i can not assist any further without more information .
kissing is something you can not do wrong or right .
take time to decide .
enjoying yourself with male friends is acceptable .
i would say , that it is more of a trust issue .
i need someone to assist me in figuring this out .
then move on if he still does not like you .
he probably is n't interested either .
try to make it yourself whenever possible .
can you do anything else besides work and fix things ?
i told her i sincerely loved her .
it seems that all of the male senior students think that <unk> girls are promiscuous , which unfortunate .
so , how do i simply kiss him ?

i hope that you find a nice girl to date .
i do not believe that is a good idea , you are not there for that purpose .
it is a very long list .
i would say brokeback mountain ; you will be happy even if it is a man .
if you do not base your relationship on intercourse , then it is ok .
correct , also it is a <unk> of <unk> to glimpse the betrothed at the marriage ceremony .
hold on and stay strong and good luck !
um , modest <unk> for relatives .
if you are skeptical about the performance piece of it , then do not do it .
i am married now .
i believe it is completely dependent upon age and <unk> .

your child will find it difficult enough growing up without a father .
bald men look like children to me , i do n't find it attractive .
ask what the score of the last game was .
if you are dating the guy you love you need to get rid of your ex .
the best and easiest way is to fly or drive to las vegas and get married .
of course , let me get to know you more .
i <unk> a size c or d. <unk> bigger is a waste .
deceive and mislead and then <unk> some more .
they have not performed previously and the pleasure is twice as nice !
my wife does not like to wear those <unk> .
we are unaware of what you look like .
because opposites attract and we always find a partner for life .
i think this is better than my personal life .
do n't go anywhere with you new date that you went with your ex .
speak with your best friend and determine if it is agreeable .
it sounds strange , but it worked for me , in about three to five days .
i do not like it when he teases you about the little things .
no , because i am not yet married .
a large number of males appreciate <unk> women ; they are primarily african american .

you should not get married if you feel this strongly about it .
it 's strongly dependent on whether or not a person is vain .
you need to move on and enter a relationship with someone who does not hate you .
you should <unk> acquainted with her and sooner or later one of you will ask the other out .
i asked him if he was blowing me off .
perhaps some vulgar young men enjoy the younger asian ladies .
make sure it is your decision .
tell him you are looking to keep it casual .
this situation is a challenging one with lots of problems .
they have been fairly favorable years , not always the easiest .
we have seen each other , everyday , for approximately four to five years .
imagine that i am the man you want , and then date me .
it never harms anyone to flirt a little !
you should stick with what you feel inside .
i wish you luck .
is it bad if i have not kissed the girl i have been with for eight months ?
it is the woman 's decision .
i believe they look better than many other nations .
it would be ok the day after .
see if she is <unk> for dinner and a movie .
some men do n't think of their partner when they just get to it .
please ask the question in english ; i am unable to understand you .
i apologize , but i have never felt that way .
remember , no bird has ever tried to fly with one <unk> .
i frequently think about this issue .
you will never find a significant other , if you appear to be <unk> .
i met <unk> recently , and i want to know if she likes me .
do not simply sit around and wait for the phone to ring .
be quiet and be whatever sexual orientation that you wish .
if he comes to his senses , great ; if not , you should move on .
he may love you , but he also may want to disappoint his father .
you should take action before it is too late .
this woman does n't want a man who <unk> her .
i 'd enjoy hearing the viewpoint of an african american woman regarding this subject .
please help me win this debate against her !
almost without exception ( not constantly ) those are men similar in age to yourself , more or less .
when will pepole begin to realize this ?
i 'm unsure concerning what i should do .
you visit a bar and drink until you are inebriated .
i behaved as such in the company of my present romantic partner .
if you have to ask , then that is a negative .
do not sit there and wait untill he realizes that you are a good one .
even though i am getting divorced , i am still stuck with this .
your girlfriend will only think that you are being a jerk .
perhaps you should attempt to pursue young women , given the tendency by men to be offensive .
i went out with my ex for three years and then he/she cheated .
you will know in time , and i recommend seeing what happens for six months .
well , the one i enjoyed goes something like this .
not all gentlemen break up with their woman .
going there is great fun , and there are plenty of things to do .
is it okay to kiss on the first date ?
i have a female friend that i am close with .
they lust for each other .
my friend tells me that i am too nice , and that i should tell him no .
but , because there is always an exception , is there not ?
not all men , however some men do .
by doing so , you 're still able to retain your surname .
approach her , say hello , and ask if she is single .
that really stimulated me sexually , but i ran away .
girls who are heavier can still be attractive .
not every participant present is attending <unk> courses .
practice <unk> <unk> and <unk> cherry <unk> , with your tongue .
i will pay if i can get your vote for best answer .
you should look for somewhere in public , where you will feel most comfortable .
flirt with him and gauge his reaction .
and it <unk> the pressure i 'm feeling to invite somebody .
please say you will go out with me .
she does not forget my mistakes .
how should i approach her , without her thinking i 'm just another man with bad intentions ?
as a man , i may have some insight .
do not worry , you are only 13 .
always go <unk> riding with company .
if the two of you truly love each other , then you will work things out .
eye contact is the key point .
i can lift him .
he simply has to start over , and regain your trust again .
why do you want to ask her out ?
well , i 'm hoping you 'll review this information very thoroughly .
try playing , <unk> or dare , ' together .
wait until you find out and confirm , then go from there .
that is stupid because you need a theory class for that .
just quit if you do eat something like that .
i keep thinking about sex with her .
the only way you will know is if you confront him and ask him directly .
<unk> is going to ask rubi out on a date .
the relationship is still happening because neither of you have the courage to end things .
it may be that it is interesting for them to learn about that .
he dribbles , shoots , and scores : two points .
do men truly prefer bigger women ?
he loves you as well , but only time can tell what will happen .
if a man really respects you , he will understand you .
we have started our own sins .
his answer works for me .
you can still love him , but you need to move on .
